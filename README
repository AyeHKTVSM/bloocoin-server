BlooCoin is a crypto-currency like Bitcoin that uses a central server to handle all transaction, rather than using a peer-to-peer networking system.

Server
======

Although anyone techincally can host a BlooCoin server, there is only one official server which is hard coded into the BlooCoin client. Do not connect to any other server unless you are looking to test a new feature.


Boocoin

On the start of bloocoin your bloostamp will be created. This file contains two hashes, one that is your BlooCoin address and the other that is your personal key. Do not lose this file or all your BlooCoins will be lost.

There are three commands in the BlooCoin shell.

1. coins - Returns number of coins assigned to your BlooCoin address.
2. addr - Returns your BlooCoin address.
3. send <amount> <to> - Used for sending coins to another address.

For a list of these commands within the shell, type "help"
