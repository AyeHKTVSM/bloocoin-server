BlooCoin Server
===============

BlooCoin is an eCurrency that uses a central server to handle all transaction, rather than using a peer-to-peer networking system.

Server
------

Although anyone technically can host a BlooCoin server, there is only one official server which is hard coded into the BlooCoin client. Do not connect to any other server unless you are looking to test a new feature.

__Note__: The client is located at [@bloocoin/bloocoin-client](https://github.com/bloocoin/bloocoin-client), look there if you want that.
